On this histogram, we can highlight the 2 highest points (in the range of 190-210 and 240-250), but looking at the results, we see that the optimal threshold is at around 160, so I understand that because of this, the separation occurs between the peaks of 130-140 and 190-210.\n",

    "* Looking at the computed histogram, what binarization threshold would you chose? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "    I would choose a value somewhere in the middle between the two peaks on the histogram. This will filter out the background while retaining some of the details of the image.\n",
